## Installation
There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation

The main focus of this project is to build an automatic credit card approval predictor, using a logistic regression model. 
  
## File Descriptions

There is 1 notebook including all the code used for wrangling and modelling the data. 

The dataset folder has the file including all the data for the analysis.

## Results

The results of this analysis are presented in the notebook CreditCardApproval.ipynb. You can find that we ended up with a logistic regression model with 0.85 of R2 score. 

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements

Must give credit to DataCamp for providing and orientating throughout the project, and UCI Machine Learning Repository for the data. The code can be used as any person demands.
